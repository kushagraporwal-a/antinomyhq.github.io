## Authenticate and install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up for Forge">

- [**Sign up**](https://app.forgecode.dev/app/)
- **Create your account:** You can sign up using your Google or GitHub account for quick authentication.
- **Create API Key:** Once logged in, generate your Forge API key from your account dashboard.
- **Set up environment:** Create a `.env` file in your home directory and add your API key:

```bash
# ~/.env or in your project directory
FORGE_KEY=your_forge_api_key_here
```

<div className="mt-2 text-[15px] text-gray-600">
  Once you have your account and API key set up, you can proceed with the installation.
</div>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Forge (NPM Recommended)">

Forge can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. The recommended method is using npm, which works consistently across all platforms:

```bash
npm i -g forgecode@latest
```

<div className="rounded-md border border-amber-300 bg-tailCall-border-dark-1000 px-4 py-2 mt-3 text-amber-900 text-sm flex items-start gap-2">
  <span className="mt-1 mr-2">⚠️</span>
  <span>
    Do <strong>not</strong> use <code>sudo npm install -g</code> as this can lead to permission issues and security
    risks. If you encounter permission errors, see our{" "}
    <a href="/docs/npm-troubleshooting" className="underline hover:no-underline">

    </a>{" "}
    guide for safe solutions including npm directory configuration and Node.js version managers like nvm.
  </span>
</div>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Installation">

After installation, verify that Forge is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
forge --version
```

You should see output displaying the version of Forge that you've installed.

Alternatively, you can install and use directly with npx:

```bash
npx forgecode@latest
```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Forge">

To update Forge to the latest version using npm:

```bash
# Update globally installed package
npm update -g forgecode
```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Project Context Setup">

For best results, always start Forge from your project's root directory. This provides Forge with complete context about your project structure, dependencies, and Git history.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
forge
```

**Why this matters:**

Running Forge from the project root allows it to analyze your project and dependencies, access Git history and branch information, understand your project's file structure, and provide more accurate code suggestions.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

After installing Forge, you can configure additional AI providers beyond the default. Follow the [Provider Configuration](../custom-providers) guide to set up alternative providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter.
