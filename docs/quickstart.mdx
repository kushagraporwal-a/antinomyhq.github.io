# Quickstart

Welcome to Forge! This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Forge for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A code project to work with (or create a new one)

## Step 1: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Forge:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npx forgecode@latest
```

This will run Forge. When you first run it, Forge will open your browser to <CustomLink href="https://app.forgecode.dev/app">app.forgecode.dev</CustomLink> for authorization. Complete the OAuth process to authenticate.

You'll see the Forge prompt inside a new interactive session:

```
✻ Welcome to Forge!

Context: /path/to/your/project

> Try asking "what does this project do?" or "help me add a new feature"
```

## Step 2: Understand your codebase

Let's start by having Forge analyze your project. Try one of these commands:

```
> analyze the architecture of this codebase and identify any potential issues
```

Forge will examine your project structure, dependencies, and patterns. You can also ask for specific insights:

```
> what are the main components and how do they interact?
```

```
> identify any code smells or areas that need refactoring
```

```
> show me the data flow through this application
```

```
> what testing strategy is currently in place and how can it be improved?
```

> **Note**: Forge reads your files as needed and maintains context throughout the conversation - you don't have to manually add files or repeat information.

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's have Forge write some code. Try a simple task:

```
> add a unit test for tree diffing function
```

Forge will:

1. Identify the appropriate file
2. Make the edit

## Step 4: Use Git with Forge

Forge makes Git operations conversational and intelligent:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart-demo
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve any merge conflicts
```

## Step 5: Debug and fix issues

Forge excels at debugging and problem-solving. Describe issues in natural language:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - help me fix it
```

Or ask for help with specific errors:

```
> I'm getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined" - what might be causing this?
```

Forge will:

- Analyze the error context
- Identify potential causes
- Suggest multiple solutions
- Implement fixes with your approval

## Step 6: Explore common workflows

Here are some powerful ways to work with Forge:

### <Code size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

### <Terminal size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

### <Lightbulb size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Add new features**

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

### <Bug size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

> **Tip**: Think of Forge as your AI pair programmer. Describe what you want to achieve in natural language, and it will help you get there efficiently.

## Advanced usage patterns

### Multi-step tasks

Break complex tasks into steps:

```
> 1. create a new API endpoint for user profiles
```

```
> 2. add validation for required fields
```

```
> 3. write tests for the endpoint
```

### Context-aware assistance

Let Forge explore before making changes:

```
> analyze the database schema first
```

```
> how does error handling work in this app?
```

```
> then add proper error handling to the login endpoint
```

### Specialized agents

Switch between different AI agents for specific tasks:

- **Forge Agent**: Full execution mode for implementing changes
- **Muse Agent**: Analysis mode for planning and review without modifications

### Save time with shortcuts

- Press ↑ for command history
- Use Tab for command completion
- Type `/` to see all available slash commands
